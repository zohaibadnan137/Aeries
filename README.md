# Aeries
Aeries is an airline reservation system made using Java. We've used JavaFX for the frontend, and Hibernate ORM along with MySQL for the backend. 

We've also added JUnit test cases for unit testing. 

We've made this system as a combined semester project for our Software Design and Analysis and Advanced Programming courses.
