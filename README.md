# Aeries
Aeries is an airline reservation system made using Java. We've used **JavaFX for the frontend**, and **Hibernate ORM along with MySQL for the backend**. 

We've also added JUnit test cases for unit testing. 

We've made this system as a combined semester project for our Software Design and Analysis and Advanced Programming courses.
